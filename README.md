## Introduction to Problem Definition
Problem definition is the process of identifying and understanding the problem that needs to be solved, and is the first and most critical step in the data science process. A well-defined problem statement is essential for ensuring that a data science project is focused, relevant, and delivers measurable results. It should be done by involving all the stakeholders of the project, and it should be well documented to ensure that everyone is on the same page.

## Identifying the Problem
This section provides examples and tutorials on how to identify the problem and gather information about the business or domain that the data science project will be addressing. It should be done by performing a thorough research, interviewing stakeholders, and gathering relevant data to understand the problem and its context.

## Defining the Problem Statement
This section provides examples and tutorials on how to define the problem statement and clearly articulate the problem, the scope of the project, and the context in which the problem exists. The problem statement should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). It should also include the current situation and the desired outcome.

## Formulating the Objectives and Goals
This section provides examples and tutorials on how to formulate the objectives and goals of the data science project and align them with the problem statement and business objectives. The objectives and goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) and should be aligned with the overall business strategy and objectives.

## Business Understanding
This section provides examples and tutorials on how to gain a deeper understanding of the business or domain that the data science project will be addressing, including understanding the key stakeholders, business processes, and industry trends. This understanding is crucial for identifying the problem, objectives, and goals, and for developing a solution that addresses the specific needs of the business or domain.

## Feasibility Analysis
This section provides examples and tutorials on how to perform a feasibility analysis and assess the potential impact, risks, and constraints of the data science project. Feasibility analysis should include a cost-benefit analysis, a risk analysis, and an analysis of the technical and operational feasibility.

## Data Collection and Exploration
This section provides examples and tutorials on how to collect and explore the data that will be used in the data science project, including data cleaning, transformation, and exploration. It should be done by identifying the relevant data sources, collecting the data, and performing an initial exploration of the data to understand its quality and characteristics.

## Problem Solving Approach
This section provides examples and tutorials on how to develop a problem-solving approach that outlines the steps that will be taken to solve the problem. It should include a description of the methodologies, techniques, and tools that will be used to solve the problem, as well as a plan for evaluating the effectiveness of the solution.

## Case Studies and Examples
This section provides examples of real-world data science projects that demonstrate the process of defining and understanding the problem statement, objectives, and goals. These case studies will serve as a reference and guide for defining and understanding the problem statement in your own data science projects.


## **Generally;**

* Identifying the question or questions to be answered: The first step in problem definition is to identify the question or questions that need to be answered. This includes understanding the business objectives and goals of the project, and identifying the key information that needs to be gathered.

* Defining the scope of the project: Once the question or questions have been identified, the next step is to define the scope of the project. This includes determining what data is needed, what analysis needs to be performed, and what the deliverables of the project will be.

* Defining the success criteria: Defining the success criteria for the project is important for evaluate the outcome, it means determining what metrics will be used to evaluate the success of the project.

* Identifying potential challenges and limitations: Identifying potential challenges and limitations of the project is important for understanding the feasibility of the project and for determining what resources will be required.

* Defining the stakeholders: Identifying who are the stakeholders of the project, and what are their roles and expectations, will help to ensure that the project is aligned with the needs and goals of the relevant parties.

* Defining the project timeline and budget: Defining the project timeline and budget is important for ensuring that the project can be completed within the available resources and constraints.

## Conclusion
Problem definition is the first and most critical step in the data science process. By following the tutorials and examples provided in this section, you will gain a solid understanding of how to define and understand the problem statement, objectives, and goals of a data science project using both R and Python programming languages. We hope you find this section helpful and informative. Happy defining
